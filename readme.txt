## Files and Folders

code: code used in the analysis presented in the manuscript. 
    MATMAPelev.R: get metadata for the Flux tower sites. 1.download SRTM elevation tiles and extract values for site locations 2. download WorldClim MAT/MAP tiles and extract data for site locations; 3. combine 1 and 2 into a single dataframe; 4. determine the OzFlux sites that fall within the 'dryland regions' defined by United Nations Environment World Monitoring Centre; 5. get boundaries for US, mexico, and Australia territories
    SPEI: code used to compute SPEI and extract meterological variables for flux tower locations. CRU data downloaded from: https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.04/cruts.2004151855.v4.04/ meterological variables downloaded included: precipitation (pre), tmin (tmn), tmax (tmx), vapor pressure (vap), potential evapotranspiration (pet), and Tavg (tmp) for time periods: 1991-2000; 2001-2010; 2011-2019; citation: Harris et al.

        computeSPEI.R: This script computes the global SPEI dataset at different time scales. One netCDF file covering the whole globe and time period is generated for each time scale,e.g. spei01.nc for a time scale of 1 month, etc. Output files are stored on DryFlux/data/outputNcdf

    daylength.R: determine daylength of sites based on dates of CRU dates; create daylength rasters; daylength calculated using the 'daylength' function in the 'geosphere' R package; daylength calculated on the 15th or 16th of each month in accordance with CRU dates for each flux tower location.; raster stack created for the whole world with daylengths for each of the 348 CRU dates
    CleanFlux.R: get fluxtower GPP values for mid-month time frames from the daily Fluxtower MatLab files
    MOD17A2Hdl.txt: code used on google EarthEngine to download individual .csv files of MODIS 8-day global 500m GPP data products (MOD17A2H) for each flux tower site.
    MODIS_GPP.R: get MODIS GPP values in format needed for downstream analysis. MODIS 8-day global 500m GPP data products (MOD17A2H) downloaded with google EarthEngine using code on 'MOD17A2Hdl.txt'. 
    Fluxcom_extract.R: extract daily Fluxcom predictions for tower locs, then calc mid-month GPP vals; daily Fluxcom GPP predictions requested from Fluxcom data administrator
    OxFlux.R: get OzFlux GPP values formatted for downstream analysis
    data_prepro.R: combine all response and explanatory variables together into a single dataset for model building, testing, and analysis
    RF.R: Build the Random Forest Machine Learning Models, save model outputs and evaluate performance
    applyRF.R: Apply the random forest model to raster layers to predict global GPP
    RFevaluation.R: Evaluate model performance. Create a dataframe with observed and predicted GPP values from DryFlux, MODIS, and Fluxcom. Create Fig1a-c, Fig2a-b, Table S2, Figs. S2, S3, S5, and S6
    RFseasonal.R: Evaluate seasonal trends in RF predictions at SW USA and OzFluxsites. Create Fig1d-f, Figs. S4 and S7
    RFspatial_maps.R: calcualte mid-monthly composites of Fluxcom GPP predictiosn, calculate annual GPP estimates for Fluxcom and DryFlux, create annual difference maps (Fig2c,d; Fig3c,d), calcualte DryFlux GPP z-scores globally and create maps (Figs3a,b)
